================

This is an extension for Radiant CMS, which lets you create subscriber lists, e.g. for subscription to a newsletter. 

This is essentially a stripped down version of Andrea Franz excellent [Newsletter extension](http://github.com/pilu/radiant-newsletter/tree/master). The subscriber lists extension does not require you to configure ActionMailer to send emails, so if your unsure how to do that, you may prefer to use this instead of the Newsletter extension.

Installation
------------

This extension uses the `fastercsv` gem, so if you don't already have it installed, run:

    sudo gem install fastercsv

This extension is hosted on github. If you have git installed, then `cd` to the root of your radiant project and issue this command:

    git clone git://github.com/nelstrom/radiant-subscriber-lists-extension.git vendor/extensions/subscriber_lists
  
If you don't have git, then you can instead download the tarball from this URL:

    http://github.com/nelstrom/radiant-subscriber-lists-extension/tarball/master

and expand the contents to `your-radiant-project/vendor/extensions/subscriber_lists`.

Once you have the extension added to your radiant project, you can run the rake task:

    rake radiant:extensions:subscriber_lists:install
    # and/or
    rake RAILS_ENV="production" radiant:extensions:subscriber_lists:install

Usage
-----

Create a subscriber list page by running the following task:

    rake radiant:extensions:subscriber_lists:page:new

This will create a subscriber list called "Newsletter", with all the necessary page parts.
